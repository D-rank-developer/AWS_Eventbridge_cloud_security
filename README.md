# AWS_Eventbridge_cloud_security
Automated AI  security Scanner with AWS lambda, Cloud Watch and Eventbridge
# Introducing the Project!
I’m building an AI-powered security scanner using AWS Lambda that checks
whether S3 buckets are properly encrypted, sends the findings to Gemini AI for
analysis, and generates intelligent security insights. The system runs
automatically every 12 hours using EventBridge, so it continuously monitors the
environment without manual intervention. I’m doing this to learn how serverless
security automation works in real-world cloud environments. I want to
understand how Lambda, IAM roles, S3, EventBridge, and external AI services
can be integrated into a practical security workflow. This project also helps me
strengthen my cloud security architecture skills and deepen my understanding
of detection and automated analysis. This helps me develop hands-on
experience with security monitoring, compliance validation, and AI-assisted
threat assessment.
# Key tools and concepts
The key tools I used were AWS Lambda for serverless execution, Amazon
EventBridge for scheduled automation, Amazon S3 for storage and encryption, and Amazon CloudWatch for logging and monitoring within Amazon
Web Services; the main concepts I learned were event-driven architecture,
scheduled automation, secure environment variable management, IAM-based
permission control, serverless deployment packaging, and how to transform raw
cloud security metadata into meaningful, AI-powered security insights.
